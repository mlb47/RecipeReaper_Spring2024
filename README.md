# Recipe-Reaper

Recipe-Reaper is a web application designed to help with kitchen management. Namely, its intended purpose was to allow users to create an account where they could input their groceries. Recipe Reaper would help the user manage their groceries by tracking the expiration date, reminding the user when the grocery expires.

This application was created to practice the process of developing an application in a team, following the software development process. The code was worked on by multiple indiviudals and is credited to their respective writers. I wrote/assisted with the CSS code, routes, and authentication methods using passport.js

The client code shows the webpages of Recipe Reaper, including the home, login, and grocery adding pages. These pages make API calls to the server for their functionality. The server code contains the routes to be called by the client and the associated functions. The client and server are in seperate folders, and are designed to be run separately.
